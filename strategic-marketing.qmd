Below is a selected project that showcased my work in strategic marketing. This example highlights how I apply leadership, data-informed decision making, and creative direction to drive marketing success.

In this project, I collaborated with a sports/ beauty influencer to increase brand awareness and extend my reach on social platforms. By offering a complimentary nail service in exchange for content, I strategically positioned my business in front of a highly engaged audience on TikTok.
