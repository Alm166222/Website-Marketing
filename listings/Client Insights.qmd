#### **Overview**  
In this project, I dive into engagement patterns, comments, and inquiry data from my Instagram account _nailsbydre_ to understand what services and nail styles attract the most attention. By identifying what resonates most with my audience—whether it’s French tips, chrome designs, or seasonal themes—I can tailor my offerings and content to client demand.
